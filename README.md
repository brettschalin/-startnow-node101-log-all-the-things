## Log ALL the Things!

***What this thing does***

This is a logger. It logs stuff. Specifically, it logs every user that visits its pages. You can request its logs as well (explained below).

***Usage***

There are two main functionalities. After using the command line to cd here and run `node ./server/index.js`, you can:

1. Visit any subpage on http://localhost:3000 to log your visit

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/logs to receive a JSON file of all previous visits (since the server started, at least).
